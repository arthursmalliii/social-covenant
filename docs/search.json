    "section": "",
    "text": "The peaceful transfer of power from one legitimately elected regime to another is non-negotiable hallmark of democracy. In the United States this tradition has been honored in an unbroken chain from the very first transfer, in 1797, when George Washington willingly stepped down to hand the reins of the presidency to his elected successor, John Adams.\nUntil January 6, 2021, when, shockingly, the chain snapped.\n===\n[Fill out the paragraph below after reviewing first-hand reports about the events of Jan. 6.]\n\nAssault insurrection Jan 6, 2021\n\nGraphical description. Bear spray. assault weapons. zip ties. 6 deaths, noose. after pelosi, aoc, …\nCrouching on the floor. texting spouses. blockading the front door with guns…\n\nQuote(s) from the four Capitol Police officers. Astonishment that the insurrection happened, and that there is no consensus description of what happened.\n\n===\nJanuary 6, 2021, was a singular event. But it did not come out of the blue. It was shocking, but not surprising. Everything depends on whether we can unveil the antecedent conditions that enabled, and eventually made inevitable, this rupture. Everything depends on uncovering the correct understanding of what brought us to this point.\nWe are living through a breakdown of American political civil society. Enflamed by fears of losing their traditional dominance, and ashamed of losing that dominance to coastal elites, brown people, and immigrants, one-third of the American people are jettisoning democracy and embracing fascism.\nThe forces that brought us to this crisis are not recent. They are deeply rooted in American history, and even our pre-history. Finding our way to a healthier America requires looking way back to the ideas and forces that brought us this sickness.\nThis book is motivated by three questions. How did this happen? How did we get to this place? And perhaps most important: How do we get out of it?\n===\nA sneak preview of our conclusions is warranted.\nWe are living now through one of the most alarming periods in American history. There is much grounds for feeling pessimism. Yet we believe there is a way forward to a better America, founded on a new social covenant."

    "text": "1.7 The project we undertake in this book\nOur project in this book is to update social contract theory for the 21st Century and beyond.\nWe argue that before entering into a social contract, a community must first form its social covenant.\nIn Part I, we review concepts and examples of social covenants in scripture and in pre-modern history. These covenants typically involved divine sanction or divine command.\nIn Part II, we review the concept of the social contract, and how it grew out of the philosophical environment of the Enlightenment. We also discuss how, where, and why the political project of the Enlightenment went wrong. (Did it?) Spoiler alert: the mistakes were to lose sight of the sacred and spiritual nature of the covenant, and to lose sight of human flourishing as the only appropriate objective for political arrangements.\nStarting in Part III, we examine deeply the philosophical foundations of the Enlightenment political project. We focus on the key concepts of autonomy, self-governance, reason, and eudaemonia a.k.a. human flourishing.\nPart IV discusses the political arrangements that underpin conditions that support human flourishing. It investigates how the social covenant relates to the social contract and to the constitution.\nIn Part V, we propose a new social covenant for the United States. We offer proposed text, and describe the form of ritual ceremony in which it would be adopted, proclaimed, and affirmed."

    "text": "2.5 Common features of divine covenants\nThe covenant creates a new tribe, community, or nation. By participating in the covenant, a collection of individuals forms a new tribe - bound together with reciprocal ties of loyalty, responsibility, claims and obligations.\n*The terms of the covenant define the social compact for the new tribe.\nEntering into the covenant changes the individual participants fundamentally. The act of joining the tribe is also a event of individual re-birth. It changes who you are.\nGod sets the terms. The asymmetry in power between God and man is absolute.\nBecause God sets the terms entirely, the covenant cannot really be called a contract. A contract is a voluntary agreement between parties that seeks to advance mutual interest. Even if one party entirely sets the terms, others have the option to decline.\nIn all the biblical covenant stories, there is no sense whatsoever that man has any leverage, any option of refusal. The Covenant is God’s gift, and God’s command, framed entirely on God’s terms. It’s not even a take-it-or-leave-it offer: there is no genuine option to leave-it, that one can discern.\n(There are other biblical stories that do involve bargaining with the divine, e.g., in the story of Sodom and Gommorah “What if I can find just ten righteous men?”, or Satan’s bargaining with God over the fate of Job. But these are not covenant stories. They don’t concern the terms for forming a new community or nation.)"

In joining this community, you are now someone new.\nAcross geography and time, the rituals of adopting a social covenant share notable commonalities. The entire community assembles. A leadership figure proclaims from a stage. For the most important moments of transformation, the entire congregation stands, signalling the seriousness of the moment. The language used is poetic, not administrative, nor vulgar, not ordinary. Everyone is dressed as well as their resources permit. The mood is solemn.\nPeriodic rituals reaffirm the commitment to the community.\nAlways, symbols are used to stand for the community as a whole, and indicate membership in it.

These values are not stated with legal precision. The statement of principle does not cover all cases of application, and is not intended to.\nThe covenant does not describe the process of governance. It does not state the number of members in representative political bodies, their powers, and the mechanisms of their selection and replacement. Rather, the covenant states objectives and constraints that governance processes must adhere to.\nWhy does it matter that the covenant is incomplete?\nFirst, because, practically the covenantal statement must be short. It is a broad statement of values, goals, principles. It cannot cover everything. And this is critical: it must not pretend to.\nInstead, it offers a way for us as a community to think about how we handle particular challenges.\nWhat are the rights of the accused? How do we extend freedom of speech and of the press into the age of social media?\nWe do not look on our constitution as a legal contract between parties drawn together by self-interest. If we did, we might try to excavate what these exact words signified in the late 18th Century. Instead, we look to the values they understood."

    "text": "We share icons. The pages of my jumbo-sized passport are dyed with images of The Liberty Bell, The Declaration of Independence, Independence Hall, farmers navigating teams of oxen, Mount Rushmore, cacti catching a southwestern desert sky, a grizzly siezing a salmon underneath the guard of a northwest native American totem pole.\nAbove these images hang quotes from great American fathers. Horace Greeley urges an unnamed protege to “Go West, young man, and grow up with the country.” Thomas Jefferson. Even Ronald Reagan makes an appearance. (The halls of this particular American Valhalla seem extra busy with the voices of White Christian men.)\nThese quoted words, these images, together urge on us a story. We are, they reassure us, a nation.\nPerhaps even more fundamental than the specifics of the story is the reassuring message that there is a story. America has a story that makes sense. By this story, we can make sense of ourselves. We can locate ourselves in relation to our past, to our neighbors, to the landscape.\n“We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” So wrote Joan Didion, an American writer whose insightful analysis of 20th Century America has inspired many but who has not, thus far, been honored with her own entry in the pages of a passport book. At least, not a passport of the official kind recognized by border control agents.\n“If you don’t have borders you don’t have a country.” So offered another commentator on the American condition, Donald Trump. He missed the point. A nation’s borders are far less important than its defining narratives – the stories its people tell themselves about who they are.\nAmerica is having trouble these days. We can’t decide together which story we are living in. Which script we are reading from. Whose inspiring quotes we are quoting to one another.\nIt’s like we’ve each been issued a passport with thousands of pages. Many pages offer us lovely, uplifting language by some statesman or -woman, some writer, some public figure. Each page inspires, persuades, provokes, uplifts. But we are having trouble, more and more trouble, finding the common story that ties all these messages together.\nEach of us can rifle the pages. We read messages that tell us each who we are and what kind of nation we are. They seem important. We want to understand. We start to piece together a story that makes sense to us.\nConfused, excited, anxious about getting it wrong, we reach out and find others who have attempted this task of story crafting, of finding coherence, of making sense. When we find a group who seems ahead of us in the game, we are overjoyed, relieved. We are making it work. We are indeed a tribe. We have a story together. Therefore, we are a nation.\nThen we run into apostates. People who have focused on other pages in their passports.\nA central confusion in the U.S. today concerns the disputed terms of our unwritten social covenant, and confusion over the difference between our covenant and our Constitution.\n\n3.0.1 The U.S. has a de facto social covenant\nThe U.S. has a written social contract: the Constitution.\nThe U.S. has an unwritten social covenant. In fact, more than one.\nOur social covenant is spread over a few places: The Declaration of Independence. The Preamble to the Constitution. The Bill of Rights. The Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n\n3.0.2 The social convenant of the U.S. is contested\nSome basic terms of our social covenant have never been settled.\nWho is a full member of the community?\nWhat are the rights and obligations of community members to one another?\nWhat role does religion and religious scripture hold in setting the terms of the covenant – if any?"

    "text": "4.5 Common features of divine covenants\nThe covenant creates a new tribe, community, or nation. By participating in the covenant, a collection of individuals forms a new tribe - bound together with reciprocal ties of loyalty, responsibility, claims and obligations.\n*The terms of the covenant define the social compact for the new tribe.\nEntering into the covenant changes the individual participants fundamentally. The act of joining the tribe is also a event of individual re-birth. It changes who you are.\nGod sets the terms. The asymmetry in power between God and man is absolute.\nBecause God sets the terms entirely, the covenant cannot really be called a contract. A contract is a voluntary agreement between parties that seeks to advance mutual interest. Even if one party entirely sets the terms, others have the option to decline.\nIn all the biblical covenant stories, there is no sense whatsoever that man has any leverage, any option of refusal. The Covenant is God’s gift, and God’s command, framed entirely on God’s terms. It’s not even a take-it-or-leave-it offer: there is no genuine option to leave-it, that one can discern.\n(There are other biblical stories that do involve bargaining with the divine, e.g., in the story of Sodom and Gommorah “What if I can find just ten righteous men?”, or Satan’s bargaining with God over the fate of Job. But these are not covenant stories. They don’t concern the terms for forming a new community or nation.)"

Moore: Introduced the naturalistic fallacy. Target: utilitarianism. Bentham et al.\nIf you define “good” = “pleasure”, then you assert: meaning of good = meaning of pleasure.\nThen it would make no sense to ask: Q: “Is pleasure good?”\nBut Q is an informative question. Therefore, good cannot be defined as pleasure.\nCalled the open question argument.\nInvolves paradox of analysis: If you give an analysis, you give meaning of things in terms of other terms.\nBut if analysis is only matching conceptual identity, then analysis cannot generate new information.\nFrege: “A = A” is not informative. “A = B” is informative. But..\nLeads to sense-reference distinction.\nFundamental question: Suppose we want to say that flourishing is good. Can we ask this question?\nCould the answer be “No”? Could we entertain circumstances under which human flourishing is not a good thing?\nHypothesis: we cannot say this. We cannot imagine any conditions under which this is false.\nOpen Question Argument suggests: “pleasure = good” might be false.\nAssertion: Relationship between “flourishing” and “good” is the same as the relationship between “murder” and “immoral” / “morally unjustified”.\nClaim: Instances of the property of “genuine flourishing” will always be a sub-class of the property of “good”.\nKey question: Why is it so difficult to imagine instances of flourishing that are not good?\nLook for specific instances:\nWhen we see flourishing, why is it so hard to reject the assertion that this is good?"
